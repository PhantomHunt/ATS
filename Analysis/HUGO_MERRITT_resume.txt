2. **Building Relevant Projects:**
   - Develop independent or collaborative projects involving NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis or named entity recognition. Post results on GitHub to create a portfolio.

3. **Cloud Deployment Experience:**
   - Seek internships or projects that involve deploying models on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) to fulfill the cloud experience requirement.

4. **Familiarity with CI/CD Practices:**
   - Learn about CI/CD principles and tools (like Jenkins or GitHub Actions) to strengthen understanding on deployment practices in machine learning environments.

5. **Networking and Mentorship:**
   - Consider joining industry-related groups or seeking mentorship from experienced professionals in NLP to gain insights and job-relevant skills.

By addressing these gaps, Hugo can significantly improve his chances of securing a position in the desired field.
