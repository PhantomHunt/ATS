**4. Identify Missing Requirements:**
- **Skills Missing:**
  - Proficiency in core NLP libraries (NLP-related work is not evident in current responsibilities).
  - Direct experience with deploying solutions in AWS, GCP, or Azure.
  - Familiarity with Python web frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django).
  - Experience with containerization technologies (Docker, Kubernetes).
  - Direct experience with CI/CD pipelines.

### Overall Suitability Score: 
**Score:** 60/100

### Breakdown of the Score:
- Skills Match: 45/100
- Experience Match: 40/100
- Education Match: 100/100

### Recommendations for the Candidate to Address Gaps:
1. **Develop Proficiency in Core NLP Libraries**: Engage in projects or online courses focused on NLTK, SpaCy, and Hugging Face's Transformers. Building small projects demonstrating explicit use of these libraries will strengthen their profile.

2. **Gain Experience in Cloud Deployment**: Explore cloud basics and gain experience deploying applications in AWS, Azure, or GCP. Tutorials and certifications can help in this area.

3. **Familiarize with RESTful API Development**: Learn frameworks like Flask or Django by creating small applications that serve NLP models. 

4. **Understand Containerization**: Acquire skills in Docker and Kubernetes through courses or hands-on projects to build familiarity with deploying microservices.

5. **Highlight Transferable Skills**: In the resume or cover letter, emphasize experiences that relate indirectly to NLP and document AI, such as sentiment analysis or user engagement projects.

By addressing these gaps, Isolde Fairchild can significantly improve her suitability for the Machine Learning Engineer position focused on Natural Language Processing.
